## Core Capabilities

### Simplified HTTP Operations

- Provide a streamlined API for executing common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) with minimal boilerplate.

### Flexible Request Configuration

- Allow dynamic configuration of HTTP requests, including headers, query parameters, and body content from POJOs.

### Automatic Response Mapping

- Automatically map HTTP responses to Java POJOs using `ObjectMapper`, with support for custom serialization and deserialization settings.

### Comprehensive Error Handling

- Implement a robust mechanism for handling HTTP errors, allowing users to map specific status codes to custom exceptions.
- Provide default exception handling for unexpected errors with detailed error messages.

### Timeout and Retry Configuration

- Allow configuration of request timeouts and potentially retries, giving users control over request execution behavior.

### Extensible Design

- Offer interfaces or abstract classes that enable developers to extend and customize the library's functionality, such as adding custom error handlers or authentication mechanisms.

### List Handling

- Support operations that return collections, using `ParameterizedTypeReference` to handle generic types seamlessly.

### Builder Pattern

- Potentially use a builder pattern for constructing requests, providing a fluent and intuitive API for users to customize requests.

## Additional Features

### Logging and Monitoring

- Integrate logging capabilities to help trace requests and responses, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

### Modular Configuration

- Separate configuration concerns (e.g., WebClient, ObjectMapper) into distinct modules, allowing users to plug in their own configurations.

### Advanced Serialization Support

- Support for advanced JSON handling, including custom serializers/deserializers and handling of Java 8+ date/time types.

### Security Features

- Include support for common authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2, JWT) as part of request configuration.

## Unique Selling Points

### Declarative Error Mapping

- Enable users to declaratively map HTTP status codes to exceptions using a simple, intuitive mechanism.

### Reactive and Synchronous Support

- While primarily using `WebClient`, provide options for both reactive and traditional synchronous request handling.

### Ease of Integration

- Designed to integrate seamlessly into existing Java and Spring applications, minimizing the learning curve and setup time.
